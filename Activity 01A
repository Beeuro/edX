## Profile
I want to create and reimagine infrastructure to build smarter cities
Our plan is to use an application interface from my startup to collect data
Until there is a better method to wrangle information I will be using RAM from each device or the traditonal method to collect 100% of user data
name = "Matthew Fagen"
age = "34"
print("My name is " + name + " I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
if true
def print_box_with_true():
    message = "I am an entrepreneur with Obamacare."
