	#Python
## Return to the `LearnPython` folder is implicit

## Inside `LearnPython`, create another folder called `Assignment2'
!mkdir -p learnpython/Assignment2

## Inside `Assignment2`, create a file called `quick_python2.py` and add a different print statement.
with open('LearnPython/Assignment2/quick_python2.py', 'w') as f:
    f.write('print("Hello from Assignment 2!")\n')

## Run `quick_python2.py`.
exec(open('LearnPython/Assignment2/quick_python2.py').read())

	#Variables
## Define the variables based on the file's content
frankfurter = "Frankfurter"
age = 80
is_delicious = true

## Type checking
type_frankfurter = type(frankfurter)
type_age = type(age)
type_is_delicious = type(is_delicious)

## String formatting using f-string
formatted_string = f"this is a {frankfurter}, it is {age} years old, and it is {'delicious' if is_delicious else 'not delicious'}."

## Type conversion
age_str = str(age)
is_delicious_str = str(is_delicious)

## Mathematical operations
age_next_year = age + 1

## Boolean logic
not_delicious = not is_delicious

## Printing and concatenation
## Since we cannot print directly in this environment, we'll simulate the print outputs as concatenated strings.
print_simulation = [
    "Frankfurter type: " + str(type_frankfurter),
    "Age type: " + str(type_age),
    "Is delicious type: " + str(type_is_delicious),
    "Formatted string: " + formatted_string,
    "Age as string: " + age_str,
    "Is delicious as string: " + is_delicious_str,
    "Age next year: " + str(age_next_year),
    "Is not delicious: " + str(not_delicious)
]

	#Hello world
## Define the variables as per the instructions given
name = "John Doe"
country = "Canada"
age = 30
hourly_wage = 20
satisfied = true

## Calculate daily_wage based on hourly_wage
daily_wage = hourly_wage * 8

## Use traditional string concatenation to print name, country, age, and hourly_wage.
traditional_concatenation = "Name: " + name + ", Country: " + country + ", Age: " + str(age) + ", Hourly Wage: $" + str(hourly_wage)

## Use an f-string to print daily_wage and satisfied.
f_string_output = f"Daily Wage: ${daily_wage}, Satisfied: {satisfied}"

## Simulate the print output by returning the strings

	#Prompts
## Implementing the Described Functionality
## Direct user input cannot be collected in this environment, so we'll simulate it with predefined values.
user_name = "Alice"
user_age = "30"  # This will be a string initially, as if collected from user input
user_truthy_input = "yes"  # Simulating a user input for truthy value

## Convert the age from string to integer
age_int = int(user_age)

## Convert the truthy input to boolean. For simplicity, let's assume "yes" is truthy and anything else is falsy.
is_truthy = user_truthy_input.lower() in ["yes", "true", "1"]

## Exploring Data Types and Conversions
# Already demonstrated above with age and truthy input conversion.

## Input Validation
## Here we check if the user_age is indeed convertible to an integer without causing an error.
try:
    valid_age = int(user_age)  # Attempt conversion to validate
    age_validation = "Valid integer age."
except ValueError:
    age_validation = "Invalid age input. Please enter a numeric value."

## For the truthy input, we simply check against known truthy values as validation.

## Error Handling
## This would typically involve trying to catch errors during conversion, but since we've preemptively validated inputs,
## we've already incorporated a basic form of error handling. Further error handling would involve more complex scenarios.

## Customized Responses based on the input
response_name = f"Hello, {user_name}!"
response_age = f"You are {age_int} years old."
response_truthy = "You consider this input truthy." if is_truthy else "You consider this input falsy."

## Simulated print outputs as we cannot use print statements directly here
simulated_outputs = [
    response_name,
    response_age,
    response_truthy,
    age_validation
]

	#Input
## Since we cannot collect user input directly in this environment, let's simulate it with predefined values.
## Simulating input collection
user_coding_months = "12"  # Assume the user inputs 12 months
neighbor_coding_months = "9"  # Assume the neighbor inputs 9 months

## Data Validation and Conversion
## Validate and convert the coding months from strings to integers.
try:
    user_coding_months_int = int(user_coding_months)
    neighbor_coding_months_int = int(neighbor_coding_months)
    validation_message = "Both inputs are valid integers."
except ValueError:
    validation_message = "One or both inputs are invalid. Please enter numeric values."
    user_coding_months_int = neighbor_coding_months_int = 0  # Set to 0 to avoid calculation errors in case of invalid input.

## Calculation
total_coding_months = user_coding_months_int + neighbor_coding_months_int

## Result Presentation
result_message = f"Combined, you and your neighbor have {total_coding_months} months of coding experience."

## Compile all actions into a simulated print output
simulated_outputs = [
    validation_message,
    result_message
